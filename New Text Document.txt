ðŸ’– A Thought from Akriti Sohane, Founder of Pinklish
Being a girl who loves pink, Iâ€™ve always felt a deep connection to the softness, strength, and sparkle that this color brings.

Pink isnâ€™t just a color itâ€™s an emotion. Itâ€™s the comfort of feeling pretty, the power of being bold, and the joy of embracing your feminine side without holding back.

I created Pinklish for every girlie out there who lights up when she sees blush, rose, peach, or magenta. This is for the ones who dream in pink, dress in pink, and live in pink.

This app is dedicated to all my pretty ladies who carry confidence in curls, wear love like lipstick, and let their personality shine in every shade of pink. You inspire me  and Pinklish is my way of celebrating you.

With all the love,
Akriti Sohane
